Pre-compiled and configured installation packages for pgAdmin 4 are available
for a number of desktop environments; we recommend using an installer whenever
possible.  If you are interested in learning more about the project, or if a
pgAdmin installer is not available for your environment, the pages listed below
will provide detailed information about creating a custom deployment.
