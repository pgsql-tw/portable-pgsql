`Backup Globals Dialog`:index:
******************************

Use the *Backup Globals* dialog to create a plain-text script that recreates all
of the database objects within a cluster, and the global objects that are shared
by those databases. Global objects include tablespaces, roles, and object
properties. You can use the pgAdmin *Query Tool* to play back a plain-text
script, and recreate the objects in the backup.

Use the fields in the *General* tab to specify the following:

* Enter the name of the backup file in the *Filename* field.  Optionally, select
  the *Browser* icon (ellipsis) to the right to navigate into a directory and
  select a file that will contain the archive.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Role name* to specify a role with
  connection privileges on the selected server.  The role will be used for
  authentication during the backup.

Move switches in the **Miscellaneous** field box to specify the type of
statements that should be included in the backup.

* Move the *Verbose messages* switch to the *No* position to exclude status
  messages from the backup. The default is *Yes*.
* Move the *Force double quote on identifiers* switch to the *Yes* position to
  name identifiers without changing case. The default is *No*.

Click the *Backup* button to build and execute a command based on your
selections; click the *Cancel* button to exit without saving work.

additional information for troubleshooting.
