`User Management Dialog`:index:
*******************************

When invoking pgAdmin in desktop mode, a password is randomly generated, and
then ignored.  If you install pgAdmin in server mode, you will be prompted for
an administrator email and password for the pgAdmin client.

When you authenticate with pgAdmin, the server definitions associated with that
login role are made available in the tree control.  An administrative user can
use the *User Management* dialog to

* add or delete pgAdmin roles
* assign privileges
* manage the password associated with a role

Use the *Filter by email* search field to find a user; enter a user's email
address to find a user.  If the user exists, the *User Management* table will
display the user's current information.

To add a user, click *Add* to add new role.

Provide information about the new pgAdmin role in the row:

* Click in the *Email* field, and provide an email address for the user; this
  address will be used to recover the password associated with the role should
  the password be lost.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Role* to select whether a user is an
  *Administrator* or a *User*.

   * Select *Administrator* if the user will have administrative privileges
     within the pgAdmin client.
   * Select *User* to create a non-administrative user account.

* Move the *Active* switch to the *No* position if the account is not currently
  active; the default is *Yes*. Use this switch to disable account activity
  without deleting an account.
* Use the *New password* field to provide the password associated with the user
  specified in the *Email* field.
* Re-enter the password in the *Confirm password* field.

To discard a user, and revoke access to pgAdmin, click the trash icon to the
left of the row and confirm deletion in the *Delete user?* dialog.

Users with the *Administrator* role are able to add, edit and remove pgAdmin
users, but otherwise have the same capabilities as those with the *User* role.

* Click the *Help* button (?) to access online help.
* Click the *Close* button to save work. You will be prompted to return to the
  dialog if your selections cannot be saved.
