It is a good policy to routinely change your password to protect data, even in
what you may consider a 'safe' environment. In the workplace, failure to apply
an appropriate password policy could leave you in breach of Data Protection
laws.

Please consider the following guidelines when selecting a password:

* Ensure that your password is an adequate length; 6 characters should be the
  absolute minimum number of characters in the password.
* Ensure that your password is not open to dictionary attacks. Use a mixture of
  upper and lower case letters and numerics, and avoid words or names. Consider
  using the first letter from each word in a phrase that you will remember
  easily but is an unfamiliar acronym.
* Ensure that your password is changed regularly; at minimum, change it every
  ninety days.

The guidelines above should be considered a starting point: They are not a
comprehensive list and they **will not guarantee security**.
