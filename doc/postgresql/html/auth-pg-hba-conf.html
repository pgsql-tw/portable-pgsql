   Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file,
   which traditionally is named
   <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> and is stored in the database
   cluster's data directory.
   (<acronym class="acronym">HBA</acronym> stands for host-based authentication.) A default
   <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is installed when the data
   directory is initialized by <code class="command">initdb</code>.  It is
   possible to place the authentication configuration file elsewhere,
   however; see the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-file-locations.html#GUC-HBA-FILE">hba_file</a> configuration parameter.
  </p><p>
   The general format of the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <code class="literal">#</code> comment character.
   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <code class="literal">all</code> or <code class="literal">replication</code>) makes the word lose its special
   meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </p><p>
   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fall-through</span>”</span> or
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">backup</span>”</span>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
   access is denied.
  </p><p>
   A record can have one of the seven formats

       Specifies which database name(s) this record matches.  The value
       <code class="literal">all</code> specifies that it matches all databases.
       The value <code class="literal">sameuser</code> specifies that the record
       matches if the requested database has the same name as the
       requested user.  The value <code class="literal">samerole</code> specifies that
       the requested user must be a member of the role with the same
       name as the requested database.  (<code class="literal">samegroup</code> is an
       obsolete but still accepted spelling of <code class="literal">samerole</code>.)
       Superusers are not considered to be members of a role for the

       members of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by
       virtue of being a superuser.
       The value <code class="literal">replication</code> specifies that the record
       matches if a physical replication connection is requested (note that
       replication connections do not specify any particular database).
       Otherwise, this is the name of
       a specific <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> database.
       Multiple database names can be supplied by separating them with

       Specifies which database user name(s) this record

       matches all users.  Otherwise, this is either the name of a specific
       database user, or a group name preceded by <code class="literal">+</code>.
       (Recall that there is no real distinction between users and groups
       in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>; a <code class="literal">+</code> mark really means
       <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">match any of the roles that are directly or indirectly members
       of this role</span>”</span>, while a name without a <code class="literal">+</code> mark matches
       only that specific role.) For this purpose, a superuser is only
       considered to be a member of a role if they are explicitly a member
       of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of
       being a superuser.
       Multiple user names can be supplied by separating them with commas.
       A separate file containing user names can be specified by preceding the
       file name with <code class="literal">@</code>.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>address</code></em></span></dt><dd><p>
       Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record
       matches.  This field can contain either a host name, an IP
       address range, or one of the special key words mentioned below.
      </p><p>
       An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation
       for the range's starting address, then a slash (<code class="literal">/</code>)
       and a <acronym class="acronym">CIDR</acronym> mask length.  The mask
       length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
       IP address that must match.  Bits to the right of this should
       be zero in the given IP address.
       There must not be any white space between the IP address, the
       <code class="literal">/</code>, and the CIDR mask length.
      </p><p>
       Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are
       <code class="literal">172.20.143.89/32</code> for a single host, or
       <code class="literal">172.20.143.0/24</code> for a small network, or
       <code class="literal">10.6.0.0/16</code> for a larger one.
       An IPv6 address range might look like <code class="literal">::1/128</code>
       for a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or
       <code class="literal">fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</code> for a small
       network.
       <code class="literal">0.0.0.0/0</code> represents all
       IPv4 addresses, and <code class="literal">::0/0</code> represents
       all IPv6 addresses.
       To specify a single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or
       128 for IPv6.  In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.
      </p><p>
       An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections,
       and an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections,
       even if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.
       Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's
       C library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.
      </p><p>
       You can also write <code class="literal">all</code> to match any IP address,
       <code class="literal">samehost</code> to match any of the server's own IP
       addresses, or <code class="literal">samenet</code> to match any address in any
       subnet that the server is directly connected to.
      </p><p>
       If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address
       range or a special key word is treated as a host name),
       that name is compared with the result of a reverse name
       resolution of the client's IP address (e.g., reverse DNS
       lookup, if DNS is used).  Host name comparisons are case
       insensitive.  If there is a match, then a forward name
       resolution (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host
       name to check whether any of the addresses it resolves to are
       equal to the client's IP address.  If both directions match,
       then the entry is considered to match.  (The host name that is
       used in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> should be the one that
       address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns,
       otherwise the line won't be matched.  Some host name databases
       allow associating an IP address with multiple host names, but
       the operating system will only return one host name when asked
       to resolve an IP address.)
      </p><p>
       A host name specification that starts with a dot
       (<code class="literal">.</code>) matches a suffix of the actual host
       name.  So <code class="literal">.example.com</code> would match
       <code class="literal">foo.example.com</code> (but not just
       <code class="literal">example.com</code>).
      </p><p>
       When host names are specified
       in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>, you should make sure that
       name resolution is reasonably fast.  It can be of advantage to
       set up a local name resolution cache such
       as <code class="command">nscd</code>.  Also, you may wish to enable the
       configuration parameter <code class="varname">log_hostname</code> to see
       the client's host name instead of the IP address in the log.
      </p><p>
       This field only applies to <code class="literal">host</code>,
       <code class="literal">hostssl</code>, and <code class="literal">hostnossl</code> records.
      </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Users sometimes wonder why host names are handled
        in this seemingly complicated way, with two name resolutions
        including a reverse lookup of the client's IP address.  This
        complicates use of the feature in case the client's reverse DNS
        entry is not set up or yields some undesirable host name.
        It is done primarily for efficiency: this way, a connection attempt
        requires at most two resolver lookups, one reverse and one forward.
        If there is a resolver problem with some address, it becomes only
        that client's problem.  A hypothetical alternative
        implementation that only did forward lookups would have to
        resolve every host name mentioned in
        <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> during every connection attempt.
        That could be quite slow if many names are listed.
        And if there is a resolver problem with one of the host names,
        it becomes everyone's problem.
       </p><p>
        Also, a reverse lookup is necessary to implement the suffix
        matching feature, because the actual client host name needs to
        be known in order to match it against the pattern.
       </p><p>
        Note that this behavior is consistent with other popular
        implementations of host name-based access control, such as the
        Apache HTTP Server and TCP Wrappers.

       These two fields can be used as an alternative to the
       <em class="replaceable"><code>IP-address</code></em><code class="literal">/</code><em class="replaceable"><code>mask-length</code></em>
       notation.  Instead of
       specifying the mask length, the actual mask is specified in a
       separate column. For example, <code class="literal">255.0.0.0</code> represents an IPv4
       CIDR mask length of 8, and <code class="literal">255.255.255.255</code> represents a
       CIDR mask length of 32.
      </p><p>

       After the <em class="replaceable"><code>auth-method</code></em> field, there can be field(s) of
       the form <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em><code class="literal">=</code><em class="replaceable"><code>value</code></em> that
       specify options for the authentication method. Details about which
       options are available for which authentication methods appear below.
      </p><p>
       In addition to the method-specific options listed below, there is one
       method-independent authentication option <code class="literal">clientcert</code>, which
       can be specified in any <code class="literal">hostssl</code> record.
       This option can be set to <code class="literal">verify-ca</code> or
       <code class="literal">verify-full</code>. Both options require the client
       to present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate, while
       <code class="literal">verify-full</code> additionally enforces that the
       <code class="literal">cn</code> (Common Name) in the certificate matches
       the username or an applicable mapping.
       This behavior is similar to the <code class="literal">cert</code> authentication
       method (see <a class="xref" href="auth-cert.html" title="20.12. Certificate Authentication">Section 20.12</a>) but enables pairing
       the verification of client certificates with any authentication
       method that supports <code class="literal">hostssl</code> entries.
      </p></dd></dl></div><p>
  </p><p>
   Files included by <code class="literal">@</code> constructs are read as lists of names,
   which can be separated by either whitespace or commas.  Comments are
   introduced by <code class="literal">#</code>, just as in
   <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>, and nested <code class="literal">@</code> constructs are
   allowed.  Unless the file name following <code class="literal">@</code> is an absolute
   path, it is taken to be relative to the directory containing the
   referencing file.
  </p><p>
   Since the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is
   significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection
   match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later
   records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication
   methods. For example, one might wish to use <code class="literal">trust</code>
   authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for
   remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying
   <code class="literal">trust</code> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.
  </p><p>
   The <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file is read on start-up and when
   the main server process receives a
   <span class="systemitem">SIGHUP</span><a id="id-1.6.7.8.9.3" class="indexterm"></a>
   signal. If you edit the file on an
   active system, you will need to signal the postmaster
   (using <code class="literal">pg_ctl reload</code>, calling the SQL function
   <code class="function">pg_reload_conf()</code>, or using <code class="literal">kill
   -HUP</code>) to make it re-read the file.
  </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
    The preceding statement is not true on Microsoft Windows: there, any
    changes in the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> file are immediately
    applied by subsequent new connections.

   The system view
   <a class="link" href="view-pg-hba-file-rules.html" title="51.72. pg_hba_file_rules"><code class="structname">pg_hba_file_rules</code></a>
   can be helpful for pre-testing changes to the <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>
   file, or for diagnosing problems if loading of the file did not have the
   desired effects.  Rows in the view with
   non-null <code class="structfield">error</code> fields indicate problems in the
   corresponding lines of the file.
  </p><div class="tip"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
    To connect to a particular database, a user must not only pass the
    <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> checks, but must have the
    <code class="literal">CONNECT</code> privilege for the database.  If you wish to
    restrict which users can connect to which databases, it's usually
    easier to control this by granting/revoking <code class="literal">CONNECT</code> privilege
    than to put the rules in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> entries.
   </p></div><p>
