   <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> is automatically enabled; no action is
   required from the administrator except ensuring that the
   disk-space requirements for the <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> logs are met,
   and that any necessary tuning is done (see <a class="xref" href="wal-configuration.html" title="29.4. WAL Configuration">Section 29.4</a>).
  </p><p>
   <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> records are appended to the <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym>
   logs as each new record is written. The insert position is described by
   a Log Sequence Number (<acronym class="acronym">LSN</acronym>) that is a byte offset into
   the logs, increasing monotonically with each new record.
   <acronym class="acronym">LSN</acronym> values are returned as the datatype
   <a class="link" href="datatype-pg-lsn.html" title="8.20. pg_lsn Type"><code class="type">pg_lsn</code></a>. Values can be
   compared to calculate the volume of <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> data that
   separates them, so they are used to measure the progress of replication
   and recovery.
  </p><p>
   <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> logs are stored in the directory
   <code class="filename">pg_wal</code> under the data directory, as a set of
   segment files, normally each 16 MB in size (but the size can be changed
   by altering the <code class="option">--wal-segsize</code> initdb option).  Each segment is
   divided into pages, normally 8 kB each (this size can be changed via the
   <code class="option">--with-wal-blocksize</code> configure option).  The log record headers
   are described in <code class="filename">access/xlogrecord.h</code>; the record
   content is dependent on the type of event that is being logged.  Segment
   files are given ever-increasing numbers as names, starting at
   <code class="filename">000000010000000000000000</code>.  The numbers do not wrap,
   but it will take a very, very long time to exhaust the
   available stock of numbers.
  </p><p>
   It is advantageous if the log is located on a different disk from the
   main database files.  This can be achieved by moving the
   <code class="filename">pg_wal</code> directory to another location (while the server
   is shut down, of course) and creating a symbolic link from the
   original location in the main data directory to the new location.
  </p><p>
   The aim of <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> is to ensure that the log is
   written before database records are altered, but this can be subverted by
   disk drives<a id="id-1.6.16.7.7.2" class="indexterm"></a> that falsely report a
   successful write to the kernel,
   when in fact they have only cached the data and not yet stored it
   on the disk.  A power failure in such a situation might lead to
   irrecoverable data corruption.  Administrators should try to ensure
   that disks holding <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s
   <acronym class="acronym">WAL</acronym> log files do not make such false reports.
   (See <a class="xref" href="wal-reliability.html" title="29.1. Reliability">Section 29.1</a>.)
  </p><p>
   After a checkpoint has been made and the log flushed, the
   checkpoint's position is saved in the file
   <code class="filename">pg_control</code>. Therefore, at the start of recovery,
   the server first reads <code class="filename">pg_control</code> and
   then the checkpoint record; then it performs the REDO operation by
   scanning forward from the log location indicated in the checkpoint
   record.  Because the entire content of data pages is saved in the
   log on the first page modification after a checkpoint (assuming
   <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a> is not disabled), all pages
   changed since the checkpoint will be restored to a consistent
   state.
  </p><p>
   To deal with the case where <code class="filename">pg_control</code> is
   corrupt, we should support the possibility of scanning existing log
   segments in reverse order — newest to oldest — in order to find the
   latest checkpoint.  This has not been implemented yet.
   <code class="filename">pg_control</code> is small enough (less than one disk page)
   that it is not subject to partial-write problems, and as of this writing
   there have been no reports of database failures due solely to the inability
   to read <code class="filename">pg_control</code> itself.  So while it is
   theoretically a weak spot, <code class="filename">pg_control</code> does not
   seem to be a problem in practice.
