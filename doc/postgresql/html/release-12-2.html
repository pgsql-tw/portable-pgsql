      Add missing permissions checks for <code class="command">ALTER ... DEPENDS ON
      EXTENSION</code> (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      Marking an object as dependent on an extension did not have any
      privilege check whatsoever.  This oversight allowed any user to mark
      routines, triggers, materialized views, or indexes as droppable by
      anyone able to drop an extension.  Require that the calling user own
      the specified object (and hence have privilege to drop it).

      Fix <code class="command">TRUNCATE ... CASCADE</code> to ensure all relevant
      partitions are truncated (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)
     </p><p>
      If a partition of a partitioned table is truncated with
      the <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> option, and the partitioned table has
      a foreign-key reference from another table, that table must also be
      truncated.  The need to check this was missed if the referencing
      table was itself partitioned, possibly allowing rows to survive that
      violate the foreign-key constraint.
     </p><p>
      Hence, if you have foreign key constraints between partitioned
      tables, and you have done any
      partition-level <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> on the referenced table,
      you should check to see if any foreign key violations exist.  The
      simplest way is to add a new instance of the foreign key constraint
      (and, once that succeeds, drop it or the original constraint).
      That may be prohibitive from a locking standpoint, however, in which
      case you might prefer to manually query for unmatched rows.

      Fix failure to attach foreign key constraints to sub-partitions
      (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)
     </p><p>
      When adding a partition to a level below the first level of a
      multi-level partitioned table, foreign key constraints referencing
      the top partitioned table were not cloned to the new partition,
      leading to possible constraint violations later.  Detaching and
      re-attaching the new partition is the cheapest way to fix this.
      However, if there are many partitions to be fixed, adding a new
      instance of the foreign key constraint might be preferable.

      Avoid treating TID scans as sequential scans (Tatsuhito Kasahara)

      A refactoring oversight caused TID scans (selection by CTID) to be

      whole-table predicate locks as sequential scans do.  The latter
      behavior could cause unnecessary serialization errors in

      In non-text output formats, this field was emitted inside
      the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Plans</span>”</span> sub-group, resulting in syntactically
      invalid output.  Attach it to the parent Append or MergeAppend plan
      node as intended.  This causes the field to change position in text
      output format too: if there are any InitPlans attached to the same
      plan node, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Subplans Removed</span>”</span> will now appear before

      Allow the planner to apply potentially-leaky tests to child-table
      statistics, if the user can read the corresponding column of the
      table that's actually named in the query (Dilip Kumar, Amit Langote)
     </p><p>
      This change fixes a performance problem for partitioned tables that
      was created by the fix for CVE-2017-7484.  That security fix
      disallowed applying leaky operators to statistics for columns that
      the current user doesn't have permission to read directly.  However,
      it's somewhat common to grant permissions only on the parent
      partitioned table and not bother to do so on individual partitions.
      In such cases, the user can read the column via the parent, so
      there's no point in this security restriction; it only results in
      poorer planner estimates than necessary.

      Previously, if an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">index adviser</span>”</span> extension tried to
      get the planner to produce a plan involving a hypothetical BRIN
      index, that would fail, because the BRIN cost estimation code would

      Previously it was possible to break a view

      This change ensures that, with libpq and other client libraries that

      complete.  This probably makes no difference in practical

      This case never worked usefully, and it would crash on some

      Fix <span class="application">configure</span>'s probe for

      it works with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0 (Michael Paquier, Daniel

      This problem could lead to failure to set the SSL compression option

      Avoid memory leak in sanity checks for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">slab</span>”</span> memory

      This isn't an issue for production builds, since they wouldn't
      ordinarily have memory context checking enabled; but the leak could
      be quite severe in a debug build.

      Fix multiple statistics entries reported by the LWLock statistics

      The LWLock statistics code (which is not built by default; it
      requires compiling with <code class="option">-DLWLOCK_STATS</code>)
      could report multiple entries for the same LWLock and backend
      process, as a result of faulty hashtable key creation.

      Fix race condition that led to delayed delivery of interprocess

      Fix handling of a corner-case error result from

      So far as is known, this oversight just resulted in noisy log

      On Windows, retry a few times after
      an <code class="literal">ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code> file access failure

      This helps cope with cases where a file open attempt fails because
      the targeted file is flagged for deletion but not yet actually gone.
      <span class="application">pg_ctl</span>, for example, frequently failed
