    Since timezone abbreviations are not well standardized,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> provides a means to customize
    the set of abbreviations accepted by the server.  The
    <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE-ABBREVIATIONS">timezone_abbreviations</a> run-time parameter
    determines the active set of abbreviations.  While this parameter
    can be altered by any database user, the possible values for it
    are under the control of the database administrator — they
    are in fact names of configuration files stored in
    <code class="filename">.../share/timezonesets/</code> of the installation directory.
    By adding or altering files in that directory, the administrator
    can set local policy for timezone abbreviations.
   </p><p>
    <code class="varname">timezone_abbreviations</code> can be set to any file name
    found in <code class="filename">.../share/timezonesets/</code>, if the file's name
    is entirely alphabetic.  (The prohibition against non-alphabetic
    characters in <code class="varname">timezone_abbreviations</code> prevents reading
    files outside the intended directory, as well as reading editor
    backup files and other extraneous files.)
   </p><p>
    A timezone abbreviation file can contain blank lines and comments
    beginning with <code class="literal">#</code>.  Non-comment lines must have one of
    these formats:

</p><pre class="synopsis">
<em class="replaceable"><code>zone_abbreviation</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>offset</code></em>
<em class="replaceable"><code>zone_abbreviation</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>offset</code></em> D
<em class="replaceable"><code>zone_abbreviation</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>time_zone_name</code></em>
@INCLUDE <em class="replaceable"><code>file_name</code></em>
@OVERRIDE
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    A <em class="replaceable"><code>zone_abbreviation</code></em> is just the abbreviation
    being defined.  An <em class="replaceable"><code>offset</code></em> is an integer giving
    the equivalent offset in seconds from UTC, positive being east from
    Greenwich and negative being west.  For example, -18000 would be five
    hours west of Greenwich, or North American east coast standard time.
    <code class="literal">D</code> indicates that the zone name represents local
    daylight-savings time rather than standard time.
   </p><p>
    Alternatively, a <em class="replaceable"><code>time_zone_name</code></em> can be given, referencing
    a zone name defined in the IANA timezone database.  The zone's definition
    is consulted to see whether the abbreviation is or has been in use in
    that zone, and if so, the appropriate meaning is used — that is,
    the meaning that was currently in use at the timestamp whose value is
    being determined, or the meaning in use immediately before that if it
    wasn't current at that time, or the oldest meaning if it was used only
    after that time.  This behavior is essential for dealing with
    abbreviations whose meaning has historically varied.  It is also allowed
    to define an abbreviation in terms of a zone name in which that
    abbreviation does not appear; then using the abbreviation is just
    equivalent to writing out the zone name.
   </p><div class="tip"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
     Using a simple integer <em class="replaceable"><code>offset</code></em> is preferred
     when defining an abbreviation whose offset from UTC has never changed,
     as such abbreviations are much cheaper to process than those that
     require consulting a time zone definition.
    </p></div><p>
    The <code class="literal">@INCLUDE</code> syntax allows inclusion of another file in the
    <code class="filename">.../share/timezonesets/</code> directory.  Inclusion can be nested,
    to a limited depth.
   </p><p>
    The <code class="literal">@OVERRIDE</code> syntax indicates that subsequent entries in the
    file can override previous entries (typically, entries obtained from
    included files).  Without this, conflicting definitions of the same
    timezone abbreviation are considered an error.
   </p><p>
    In an unmodified installation, the file <code class="filename">Default</code> contains
    all the non-conflicting time zone abbreviations for most of the world.
    Additional files <code class="filename">Australia</code> and <code class="filename">India</code> are
    provided for those regions: these files first include the
    <code class="literal">Default</code> file and then add or modify abbreviations as needed.
   </p><p>
    For reference purposes, a standard installation also contains files
    <code class="filename">Africa.txt</code>, <code class="filename">America.txt</code>, etc, containing
    information about every time zone abbreviation known to be in use
    according to the IANA timezone database.  The zone name
    definitions found in these files can be copied and pasted into a custom
    configuration file as needed.  Note that these files cannot be directly
    referenced as <code class="varname">timezone_abbreviations</code> settings, because of
    the dot embedded in their names.
   </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
     If an error occurs while reading the time zone abbreviation set, no new
     value is applied and the old set is kept. If the error occurs while
     starting the database, startup fails.
    </p></div><div class="caution"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>
     Time zone abbreviations defined in the configuration file override
     non-timezone meanings built into <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
     For example, the <code class="filename">Australia</code> configuration file defines
     <code class="literal">SAT</code> (for South Australian Standard Time).  When this
     file is active, <code class="literal">SAT</code> will not be recognized as an abbreviation
     for Saturday.
    </p></div><div class="caution"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>
     If you modify files in <code class="filename">.../share/timezonesets/</code>,
     it is up to you to make backups — a normal database dump
     will not include this directory.
