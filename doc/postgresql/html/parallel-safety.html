    The planner classifies operations involved in a query as either
    <em class="firstterm">parallel safe</em>, <em class="firstterm">parallel restricted</em>,
    or <em class="firstterm">parallel unsafe</em>.  A parallel safe operation is one which
    does not conflict with the use of parallel query.  A parallel restricted
    operation is one which cannot be performed in a parallel worker, but which
    can be performed in the leader while parallel query is in use.  Therefore,
    parallel restricted operations can never occur below a <code class="literal">Gather</code>
    or <code class="literal">Gather Merge</code> node, but can occur elsewhere in a plan which
    contains such a node.  A parallel unsafe operation is one which cannot
    be performed while parallel query is in use, not even in the leader.
    When a query contains anything which is parallel unsafe, parallel query
    is completely disabled for that query.

    The following operations are always parallel restricted.

    The planner cannot automatically determine whether a user-defined
    function or aggregate is parallel safe, parallel restricted, or parallel
    unsafe, because this would require predicting every operation which the
    function could possibly perform.  In general, this is equivalent to the
    Halting Problem and therefore impossible.  Even for simple functions
    where it could conceivably be done, we do not try, since this would be expensive
    and error-prone.  Instead, all user-defined functions are assumed to
    be parallel unsafe unless otherwise marked.  When using
    <a class="xref" href="sql-createfunction.html" title="CREATE FUNCTION"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE FUNCTION</span></a> or
    <a class="xref" href="sql-alterfunction.html" title="ALTER FUNCTION"><span class="refentrytitle">ALTER FUNCTION</span></a>, markings can be set by specifying
    <code class="literal">PARALLEL SAFE</code>, <code class="literal">PARALLEL RESTRICTED</code>, or
    <code class="literal">PARALLEL UNSAFE</code> as appropriate.  When using
    <a class="xref" href="sql-createaggregate.html" title="CREATE AGGREGATE"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE AGGREGATE</span></a>, the
    <code class="literal">PARALLEL</code> option can be specified with <code class="literal">SAFE</code>,
    <code class="literal">RESTRICTED</code>, or <code class="literal">UNSAFE</code> as the corresponding value.
  </p><p>
    Functions and aggregates must be marked <code class="literal">PARALLEL UNSAFE</code> if
    they write to the database, access sequences, change the transaction state
    even temporarily (e.g. a PL/pgSQL function which establishes an
    <code class="literal">EXCEPTION</code> block to catch errors), or make persistent changes to
    settings.  Similarly, functions must be marked <code class="literal">PARALLEL
    RESTRICTED</code> if they access temporary tables, client connection state,
    cursors, prepared statements, or miscellaneous backend-local state which
    the system cannot synchronize across workers. For example,
    <code class="literal">setseed</code> and <code class="literal">random</code> are parallel restricted for
    this last reason.
  </p><p>
    In general, if a function is labeled as being safe when it is restricted or
    unsafe, or if it is labeled as being restricted when it is in fact unsafe,
    it may throw errors or produce wrong answers when used in a parallel query.
    C-language functions could in theory exhibit totally undefined behavior if
    mislabeled, since there is no way for the system to protect itself against
    arbitrary C code, but in most likely cases the result will be no worse than
    for any other function. If in doubt, it is probably best to label functions
    as <code class="literal">UNSAFE</code>.
  </p><p>
    If a function executed within a parallel worker acquires locks which are
    not held by the leader, for example by querying a table not referenced in
    the query, those locks will be released at worker exit, not end of
    transaction. If you write a function which does this, and this behavior
    difference is important to you, mark such functions as
    <code class="literal">PARALLEL RESTRICTED</code>
    to ensure that they execute only in the leader.
  </p><p>
    Note that the query planner does not consider deferring the evaluation of
    parallel-restricted functions or aggregates involved in the query in
    order to obtain a superior plan.  So, for example, if a <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
    clause applied to a particular table is parallel restricted, the query
    planner will not consider performing a scan of that table in the parallel
    portion of a plan.  In some cases, it would be
    possible (and perhaps even efficient) to include the scan of that table in
    the parallel portion of the query and defer the evaluation of the
    <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause so that it happens above the <code class="literal">Gather</code>
    node.  However, the planner does not do this.
