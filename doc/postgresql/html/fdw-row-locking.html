     If an FDW's underlying storage mechanism has a concept of locking
     individual rows to prevent concurrent updates of those rows, it is
     usually worthwhile for the FDW to perform row-level locking with as
     close an approximation as practical to the semantics used in
     ordinary <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> tables.  There are multiple
     considerations involved in this.
    </p><p>
     One key decision to be made is whether to perform <em class="firstterm">early
     locking</em> or <em class="firstterm">late locking</em>.  In early locking, a row is
     locked when it is first retrieved from the underlying store, while in
     late locking, the row is locked only when it is known that it needs to
     be locked.  (The difference arises because some rows may be discarded by
     locally-checked restriction or join conditions.)  Early locking is much
     simpler and avoids extra round trips to a remote store, but it can cause
     locking of rows that need not have been locked, resulting in reduced
     concurrency or even unexpected deadlocks.  Also, late locking is only
     possible if the row to be locked can be uniquely re-identified later.
     Preferably the row identifier should identify a specific version of the
     row, as <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> TIDs do.
    </p><p>
     By default, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> ignores locking considerations
     when interfacing to FDWs, but an FDW can perform early locking without
     any explicit support from the core code.  The API functions described
     in <a class="xref" href="fdw-callbacks.html#FDW-CALLBACKS-ROW-LOCKING" title="56.2.5. FDW Routines for Row Locking">Section 56.2.5</a>, which were added
     in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.5, allow an FDW to use late locking if
     it wishes.
    </p><p>
     An additional consideration is that in <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code>
     isolation mode, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> may need to re-check
     restriction and join conditions against an updated version of some
     target tuple.  Rechecking join conditions requires re-obtaining copies
     of the non-target rows that were previously joined to the target tuple.
     When working with standard <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> tables, this is
     done by including the TIDs of the non-target tables in the column list
     projected through the join, and then re-fetching non-target rows when
     required.  This approach keeps the join data set compact, but it
     requires inexpensive re-fetch capability, as well as a TID that can
     uniquely identify the row version to be re-fetched.  By default,
     therefore, the approach used with foreign tables is to include a copy of
     the entire row fetched from a foreign table in the column list projected
     through the join.  This puts no special demands on the FDW but can
     result in reduced performance of merge and hash joins.  An FDW that is
     capable of meeting the re-fetch requirements can choose to do it the
     first way.
    </p><p>
     For an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code> on a foreign table, it
     is recommended that the <code class="literal">ForeignScan</code> operation on the target
     table perform early locking on the rows that it fetches, perhaps via the
     equivalent of <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>.  An FDW can detect whether
     a table is an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>/<code class="command">DELETE</code> target at plan time
     by comparing its relid to <code class="literal">root-&gt;parse-&gt;resultRelation</code>,
     or at execution time by using <code class="function">ExecRelationIsTargetRelation()</code>.
     An alternative possibility is to perform late locking within the
     <code class="function">ExecForeignUpdate</code> or <code class="function">ExecForeignDelete</code>
     callback, but no special support is provided for this.
    </p><p>
     For foreign tables that are specified to be locked by a <code class="command">SELECT
     FOR UPDATE/SHARE</code> command, the <code class="literal">ForeignScan</code> operation can
     again perform early locking by fetching tuples with the equivalent
     of <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE</code>.  To perform late locking
     instead, provide the callback functions defined
     in <a class="xref" href="fdw-callbacks.html#FDW-CALLBACKS-ROW-LOCKING" title="56.2.5. FDW Routines for Row Locking">Section 56.2.5</a>.
     In <code class="function">GetForeignRowMarkType</code>, select rowmark option
     <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_EXCLUSIVE</code>, <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_NOKEYEXCLUSIVE</code>,
     <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_SHARE</code>, or <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_KEYSHARE</code> depending
     on the requested lock strength.  (The core code will act the same
     regardless of which of these four options you choose.)
     Elsewhere, you can detect whether a foreign table was specified to be
     locked by this type of command by using <code class="function">get_plan_rowmark</code> at
     plan time, or <code class="function">ExecFindRowMark</code> at execution time; you must
     check not only whether a non-null rowmark struct is returned, but that
     its <code class="structfield">strength</code> field is not <code class="literal">LCS_NONE</code>.
    </p><p>
     Lastly, for foreign tables that are used in an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>,
     <code class="command">DELETE</code> or <code class="command">SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE</code> command but
     are not specified to be row-locked, you can override the default choice
     to copy entire rows by having <code class="function">GetForeignRowMarkType</code> select
     option <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_REFERENCE</code> when it sees lock strength
     <code class="literal">LCS_NONE</code>.  This will cause <code class="function">RefetchForeignRow</code> to
     be called with that value for <code class="structfield">markType</code>; it should then
     re-fetch the row without acquiring any new lock.  (If you have
     a <code class="function">GetForeignRowMarkType</code> function but don't wish to re-fetch
     unlocked rows, select option <code class="literal">ROW_MARK_COPY</code>
     for <code class="literal">LCS_NONE</code>.)
