    An alternative to the built-in standby mode described in the previous
    sections is to use a <code class="varname">restore_command</code> that polls the archive location.
    This was the only option available in versions 8.4 and below. See the
    <a class="xref" href="pgstandby.html" title="pg_standby"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="application">pg_standby</span></span></a> module for a reference implementation of this.
   </p><p>
    Note that in this mode, the server will apply WAL one file at a
    time, so if you use the standby server for queries (see Hot Standby),
    there is a delay between an action in the master and when the
    action becomes visible in the standby, corresponding the time it takes
    to fill up the WAL file. <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> can be used to make that delay
    shorter. Also note that you can't combine streaming replication with
    this method.
   </p><p>
    The operations that occur on both primary and standby servers are
    normal continuous archiving and recovery tasks. The only point of
    contact between the two database servers is the archive of WAL files
    that both share: primary writing to the archive, standby reading from
    the archive. Care must be taken to ensure that WAL archives from separate
    primary servers do not become mixed together or confused. The archive
    need not be large if it is only required for standby operation.
   </p><p>
    The magic that makes the two loosely coupled servers work together is
    simply a <code class="varname">restore_command</code> used on the standby that,
    when asked for the next WAL file, waits for it to become available from
    the primary. Normal recovery
    processing would request a file from the WAL archive, reporting failure
    if the file was unavailable.  For standby processing it is normal for
    the next WAL file to be unavailable, so the standby must wait for
    it to appear. For files ending in
    <code class="literal">.history</code> there is no need to wait, and a non-zero return
    code must be returned. A waiting <code class="varname">restore_command</code> can be
    written as a custom script that loops after polling for the existence of
    the next WAL file. There must also be some way to trigger failover, which
    should interrupt the <code class="varname">restore_command</code>, break the loop and
    return a file-not-found error to the standby server. This ends recovery
    and the standby will then come up as a normal server.
   </p><p>
    Pseudocode for a suitable <code class="varname">restore_command</code> is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
triggered = false;
while (!NextWALFileReady() &amp;&amp; !triggered)
{
    sleep(100000L);         /* wait for ~0.1 sec */
    if (CheckForExternalTrigger())
        triggered = true;
}
if (!triggered)
        CopyWALFileForRecovery();
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    A working example of a waiting <code class="varname">restore_command</code> is provided
    in the <a class="xref" href="pgstandby.html" title="pg_standby"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="application">pg_standby</span></span></a> module. It
    should be used as a reference on how to correctly implement the logic
    described above. It can also be extended as needed to support specific
    configurations and environments.
   </p><p>
    The method for triggering failover is an important part of planning
    and design. One potential option is the <code class="varname">restore_command</code>
    command.  It is executed once for each WAL file, but the process
    running the <code class="varname">restore_command</code> is created and dies for
    each file, so there is no daemon or server process, and
    signals or a signal handler cannot be used. Therefore, the
    <code class="varname">restore_command</code> is not suitable to trigger failover.
    It is possible to use a simple timeout facility, especially if
    used in conjunction with a known <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code>
    setting on the primary. However, this is somewhat error prone
    since a network problem or busy primary server might be sufficient
    to initiate failover. A notification mechanism such as the explicit
    creation of a trigger file is ideal, if this can be arranged.

    The short procedure for configuring a standby server using this alternative
    method is as follows. For
    full details of each step, refer to previous sections as noted.
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
       Set up primary and standby systems as nearly identical as
       possible, including two identical copies of
       <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> at the same release level.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       Set up continuous archiving from the primary to a WAL archive
       directory on the standby server. Ensure that
       <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-MODE">archive_mode</a>,
       <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND">archive_command</a> and
       <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-TIMEOUT">archive_timeout</a>
       are set appropriately on the primary
       (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-ARCHIVING-WAL" title="25.3.1. Setting Up WAL Archiving">Section 25.3.1</a>).
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       Make a base backup of the primary server (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-BASE-BACKUP" title="25.3.2. Making a Base Backup">Section 25.3.2</a>), and load this data onto the standby.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       Begin recovery on the standby server from the local WAL
       archive, using <code class="varname">restore_command</code> that waits
       as described previously (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-PITR-RECOVERY" title="25.3.4. Recovering Using a Continuous Archive Backup">Section 25.3.4</a>).
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
   </p><p>
    Recovery treats the WAL archive as read-only, so once a WAL file has
    been copied to the standby system it can be copied to tape at the same
    time as it is being read by the standby database server.
    Thus, running a standby server for high availability can be performed at
    the same time as files are stored for longer term disaster recovery
    purposes.
   </p><p>
    For testing purposes, it is possible to run both primary and standby
    servers on the same system. This does not provide any worthwhile
    improvement in server robustness, nor would it be described as HA.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" id="WARM-STANDBY-RECORD"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">26.4.2. Record-Based Log Shipping</h3></div></div></div><p>
    It is also possible to implement record-based log shipping using this
    alternative method, though this requires custom development, and changes
    will still only become visible to hot standby queries after a full WAL
    file has been shipped.
   </p><p>
    An external program can call the <code class="function">pg_walfile_name_offset()</code>
    function (see <a class="xref" href="functions-admin.html" title="9.26. System Administration Functions">Section 9.26</a>)
    to find out the file name and the exact byte offset within it of
    the current end of WAL.  It can then access the WAL file directly
    and copy the data from the last known end of WAL through the current end
    over to the standby servers.  With this approach, the window for data
    loss is the polling cycle time of the copying program, which can be very
    small, and there is no wasted bandwidth from forcing partially-used
    segment files to be archived.  Note that the standby servers'
    <code class="varname">restore_command</code> scripts can only deal with whole WAL files,
    so the incrementally copied data is not ordinarily made available to
    the standby servers.  It is of use only when the primary dies —
    then the last partial WAL file is fed to the standby before allowing
    it to come up.  The correct implementation of this process requires
    cooperation of the <code class="varname">restore_command</code> script with the data
    copying program.
   </p><p>
    Starting with <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> version 9.0, you can use
    streaming replication (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION" title="26.2.5. Streaming Replication">Section 26.2.5</a>) to
    achieve the same benefits with less effort.
