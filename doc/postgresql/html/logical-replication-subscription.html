   A <em class="firstterm">subscription</em> is the downstream side of logical
   replication.  The node where a subscription is defined is referred to as
   the <em class="firstterm">subscriber</em>.  A subscription defines the connection
   to another database and set of publications (one or more) to which it wants
   to subscribe.
  </p><p>
   The subscriber database behaves in the same way as any other PostgreSQL
   instance and can be used as a publisher for other databases by defining its
   own publications.
  </p><p>
   A subscriber node may have multiple subscriptions if desired.  It is
   possible to define multiple subscriptions between a single
   publisher-subscriber pair, in which case care must be taken to ensure
   that the subscribed publication objects don't overlap.
  </p><p>
   Each subscription will receive changes via one replication slot (see
   <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-SLOTS" title="26.2.6. Replication Slots">Section 26.2.6</a>).  Additional temporary
   replication slots may be required for the initial data synchronization
   of pre-existing table data.
  </p><p>
   A logical replication subscription can be a standby for synchronous
   replication (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION" title="26.2.8. Synchronous Replication">Section 26.2.8</a>).  The standby
   name is by default the subscription name.  An alternative name can be
   specified as <code class="literal">application_name</code> in the connection
   information of the subscription.
  </p><p>
   Subscriptions are dumped by <code class="command">pg_dump</code> if the current user
   is a superuser.  Otherwise a warning is written and subscriptions are
   skipped, because non-superusers cannot read all subscription information
   from the <code class="structname">pg_subscription</code> catalog.
  </p><p>
   The subscription is added using <a class="xref" href="sql-createsubscription.html" title="CREATE SUBSCRIPTION"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</span></a> and
   can be stopped/resumed at any time using the
   <a class="xref" href="sql-altersubscription.html" title="ALTER SUBSCRIPTION"><span class="refentrytitle">ALTER SUBSCRIPTION</span></a> command and removed using
   <a class="xref" href="sql-dropsubscription.html" title="DROP SUBSCRIPTION"><span class="refentrytitle">DROP SUBSCRIPTION</span></a>.
  </p><p>
   When a subscription is dropped and recreated, the synchronization
   information is lost.  This means that the data has to be resynchronized
   afterwards.
  </p><p>
   The schema definitions are not replicated, and the published tables must
   exist on the subscriber.  Only regular tables may be
   the target of replication.  For example, you can't replicate to a view.
  </p><p>
   The tables are matched between the publisher and the subscriber using the
   fully qualified table name.  Replication to differently-named tables on the
   subscriber is not supported.
  </p><p>
   Columns of a table are also matched by name.  The order of columns in the
   subscriber table does not need to match that of the publisher.  The data
   types of the columns do not need to match, as long as the text
   representation of the data can be converted to the target type.  For
   example, you can replicate from a column of type <code class="type">integer</code> to a
   column of type <code class="type">bigint</code>.  The target table can also have
   additional columns not provided by the published table.  Any such columns
   will be filled with the default value as specified in the definition of the
   target table.

    As mentioned earlier, each (active) subscription receives changes from a
    replication slot on the remote (publishing) side.  Normally, the remote
    replication slot is created automatically when the subscription is created
    using <code class="command">CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</code> and it is dropped
    automatically when the subscription is dropped using <code class="command">DROP
    SUBSCRIPTION</code>.  In some situations, however, it can be useful or
    necessary to manipulate the subscription and the underlying replication
    slot separately.  Here are some scenarios:

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
       When creating a subscription, the replication slot already exists.  In
       that case, the subscription can be created using
       the <code class="literal">create_slot = false</code> option to associate with the
       existing slot.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       When creating a subscription, the remote host is not reachable or in an
       unclear state.  In that case, the subscription can be created using
       the <code class="literal">connect = false</code> option.  The remote host will then not
       be contacted at all.  This is what <span class="application">pg_dump</span>
       uses.  The remote replication slot will then have to be created
       manually before the subscription can be activated.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       When dropping a subscription, the replication slot should be kept.
       This could be useful when the subscriber database is being moved to a
       different host and will be activated from there.  In that case,
       disassociate the slot from the subscription using <code class="command">ALTER
       SUBSCRIPTION</code> before attempting to drop the subscription.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
       When dropping a subscription, the remote host is not reachable.  In
       that case, disassociate the slot from the subscription
       using <code class="command">ALTER SUBSCRIPTION</code> before attempting to drop
       the subscription.  If the remote database instance no longer exists, no
       further action is then necessary.  If, however, the remote database
       instance is just unreachable, the replication slot should then be
       dropped manually; otherwise it would continue to reserve WAL and might
       eventually cause the disk to fill up.  Such cases should be carefully
       investigated.
