     These settings control the behavior of the built-in
     <em class="firstterm">streaming replication</em> feature (see
     <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION" title="26.2.5. Streaming Replication">Section 26.2.5</a>).  Servers will be either a
     master or a standby server.  Masters can send data, while standbys
     are always receivers of replicated data.  When cascading replication
     (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#CASCADING-REPLICATION" title="26.2.7. Cascading Replication">Section 26.2.7</a>) is used, standby servers
     can also be senders, as well as receivers.
     Parameters are mainly for sending and standby servers, though some
     parameters have meaning only on the master server.  Settings may vary
     across the cluster without problems if that is required.

      These parameters can be set on any server that is
      to send replication data to one or more standby servers.
      The master is always a sending server, so these parameters must
      always be set on the master.
      The role and meaning of these parameters does not change after a
      standby becomes the master.

        Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby
        servers or streaming base backup clients (i.e., the maximum number of
        simultaneously running WAL sender processes). The default is
        <code class="literal">10</code>.  The value <code class="literal">0</code> means
        replication is disabled.  Abrupt streaming client disconnection might
        leave an orphaned connection slot behind until a timeout is reached,
        so this parameter should be set slightly higher than the maximum
        number of expected clients so disconnected clients can immediately
        reconnect.  This parameter can only be set at server start.  Also,
        <code class="varname">wal_level</code> must be set to
        <code class="literal">replica</code> or higher to allow connections from standby
        servers.
       </p><p>
         When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the

         server start.
         Setting it to a lower value than the number of currently
         existing replication slots will prevent the server from starting.
         Also, <code class="varname">wal_level</code> must be set

        Specifies the minimum number of past log file segments kept in the
        <code class="filename">pg_wal</code>
        directory, in case a standby server needs to fetch them for streaming
        replication. Each segment is normally 16 megabytes. If a standby
        server connected to the sending server falls behind by more than
        <code class="varname">wal_keep_segments</code> segments, the sending server might remove
        a WAL segment still needed by the standby, in which case the
        replication connection will be terminated.  Downstream connections
        will also eventually fail as a result.  (However, the standby
        server can recover by fetching the segment from archive, if WAL
        archiving is in use.)
       </p><p>
        This sets only the minimum number of segments retained in
        <code class="filename">pg_wal</code>; the system might need to retain more segments
        for WAL archival or to recover from a checkpoint. If
        <code class="varname">wal_keep_segments</code> is zero (the default), the system
        doesn't keep any extra segments for standby purposes, so the number
        of old WAL segments available to standby servers is a function of
        the location of the previous checkpoint and status of WAL
        archiving.
        This parameter can only be set in the
        <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file or on the server command line.

        If set to <code class="literal">on</code> (the default), this option causes new
        WAL files to be filled with zeroes.  On some file systems, this ensures
        that space is allocated before we need to write WAL records.  However,
        <em class="firstterm">Copy-On-Write</em> (COW) file systems may not benefit
        from this technique, so the option is given to skip the unnecessary
        work.  If set to <code class="literal">off</code>, only the final byte is written
        when the file is created so that it has the expected size.

        If set to <code class="literal">on</code> (the default), this option causes WAL
        files to be recycled by renaming them, avoiding the need to create new
        ones.  On COW file systems, it may be faster to create new ones, so the
        option is given to disable this behavior.

        Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer
        than this amount of time. This is useful for
        the sending server to detect a standby crash or network outage.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default value is 60 seconds.
        A value of zero disables the timeout mechanism.

        With a cluster distributed across multiple geographic
        locations, using different values per location brings more flexibility
        in the cluster management. A smaller value is useful for faster
        failure detection with a standby having a low-latency network
        connection, and a larger value helps in judging better the health
        of a standby if located on a remote location, with a high-latency

      These parameters can be set on the master/primary server that is

      <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL">wal_level</a> must be set appropriately on the master

      </span></dt><dd><p>
        Specifies a list of standby servers that can support

        <a class="xref" href="warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION" title="26.2.8. Synchronous Replication">Section 26.2.8</a>.
        There will be one or more active synchronous standbys;
        transactions waiting for commit will be allowed to proceed after
        these standby servers confirm receipt of their data.
        The synchronous standbys will be those whose names appear
        in this list, and
        that are both currently connected and streaming data in real-time
        (as shown by a state of <code class="literal">streaming</code> in the <a class="link" href="monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW" title="Table 27.5. pg_stat_replication View"><code class="literal">pg_stat_replication</code></a>
        view).
        Specifying more than one synchronous standby can allow for very high
        availability and protection against data loss.
       </p><p>
        The name of a standby server for this purpose is the
        <code class="varname">application_name</code> setting of the standby, as set in the
        standby's connection information.  In case of a physical replication
        standby, this should be set in the <code class="varname">primary_conninfo</code>
        setting; the default is the setting of <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-CLUSTER-NAME">cluster_name</a>
        if set, else <code class="literal">walreceiver</code>.
        For logical replication, this can be set in the connection
        information of the subscription, and it defaults to the
        subscription name.  For other replication stream consumers,
        consult their documentation.
       </p><p>
        This parameter specifies a list of standby servers using
        either of the following syntaxes:
</p><pre class="synopsis">
[FIRST] <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> ( <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em> [, ...] )
ANY <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> ( <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em> [, ...] )
<em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em> [, ...]
</pre><p>
        where <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> is
        the number of synchronous standbys that transactions need to
        wait for replies from,
        and <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em>
        is the name of a standby server.
        <code class="literal">FIRST</code> and <code class="literal">ANY</code> specify the method to choose
        synchronous standbys from the listed servers.
       </p><p>
        The keyword <code class="literal">FIRST</code>, coupled with
        <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em>, specifies a
        priority-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits
        wait until their WAL records are replicated to
        <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> synchronous
        standbys chosen based on their priorities. For example, a setting of
        <code class="literal">FIRST 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</code> will cause each commit to wait for
        replies from three higher-priority standbys chosen from standby servers
        <code class="literal">s1</code>, <code class="literal">s2</code>, <code class="literal">s3</code> and <code class="literal">s4</code>.
        The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher
        priority and will be considered as synchronous. Other standby servers
        appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys.
        If any of the current synchronous standbys disconnects for whatever
        reason, it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority
        standby. The keyword <code class="literal">FIRST</code> is optional.
       </p><p>
        The keyword <code class="literal">ANY</code>, coupled with
        <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em>, specifies a
        quorum-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits
        wait until their WAL records are replicated to <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span>
        <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> listed standbys.
        For example, a setting of <code class="literal">ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</code> will cause
        each commit to proceed as soon as at least any three standbys of
        <code class="literal">s1</code>, <code class="literal">s2</code>, <code class="literal">s3</code> and <code class="literal">s4</code>
        reply.
       </p><p>
        <code class="literal">FIRST</code> and <code class="literal">ANY</code> are case-insensitive. If these
        keywords are used as the name of a standby server,
        its <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em> must
        be double-quoted.
       </p><p>
        The third syntax was used before <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
        version 9.6 and is still supported. It's the same as the first syntax
        with <code class="literal">FIRST</code> and
        <em class="replaceable"><code>num_sync</code></em> equal to 1.
        For example, <code class="literal">FIRST 1 (s1, s2)</code> and <code class="literal">s1, s2</code> have
        the same meaning: either <code class="literal">s1</code> or <code class="literal">s2</code> is chosen
        as a synchronous standby.
       </p><p>
        The special entry <code class="literal">*</code> matches any standby name.
       </p><p>
        There is no mechanism to enforce uniqueness of standby names.  In case
        of duplicates one of the matching standbys will be considered as
        higher priority, though exactly which one is indeterminate.
       </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
         Each <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em>
         should have the form of a valid SQL identifier, unless it
         is <code class="literal">*</code>.  You can use double-quoting if necessary.  But note
         that <em class="replaceable"><code>standby_name</code></em>s are
         compared to standby application names case-insensitively, whether
         double-quoted or not.
        </p></div><p>
        If no synchronous standby names are specified here, then synchronous
        replication is not enabled and transaction commits will not wait for
        replication.  This is the default configuration.  Even when
        synchronous replication is enabled, individual transactions can be
        configured not to wait for replication by setting the
        <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT">synchronous_commit</a> parameter to
        <code class="literal">local</code> or <code class="literal">off</code>.
       </p><p>
        This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
        file or on the server command line.

      <a id="id-1.6.6.9.4.3.2.1.3" class="indexterm"></a>

        Specifies the number of transactions by which <code class="command">VACUUM</code> and
        <acronym class="acronym">HOT</acronym> updates will defer cleanup of dead row versions. The
        default is zero transactions, meaning that dead row versions can be
        removed as soon as possible, that is, as soon as they are no longer
        visible to any open transaction.  You may wish to set this to a
        non-zero value on a primary server that is supporting hot standby
        servers, as described in <a class="xref" href="hot-standby.html" title="26.5. Hot Standby">Section 26.5</a>.  This allows
        more time for queries on the standby to complete without incurring
        conflicts due to early cleanup of rows.  However, since the value
        is measured in terms of number of write transactions occurring on the
        primary server, it is difficult to predict just how much additional
        grace time will be made available to standby queries.
        This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
        file or on the server command line.
       </p><p>
        You should also consider setting <code class="varname">hot_standby_feedback</code>
        on standby server(s) as an alternative to using this parameter.
       </p><p>
        This does not prevent cleanup of dead rows which have reached the age

        When Hot Standby is active, this parameter determines how long the
        standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that
        conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries, as described in
        <a class="xref" href="hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-CONFLICT" title="26.5.2. Handling Query Conflicts">Section 26.5.2</a>.
        <code class="varname">max_standby_archive_delay</code> applies when WAL data is
        being read from WAL archive (and is therefore not current).
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default is 30 seconds.
        A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting

        Note that <code class="varname">max_standby_archive_delay</code> is not the same as the
        maximum length of time a query can run before cancellation; rather it
        is the maximum total time allowed to apply any one WAL segment's data.
        Thus, if one query has resulted in significant delay earlier in the
        WAL segment, subsequent conflicting queries will have much less grace
        time.

        <code class="varname">max_standby_streaming_delay</code> applies when WAL data is
        being received via streaming replication.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default is 30 seconds.
        A value of -1 allows the standby to wait forever for conflicting

        it is the maximum total time allowed to apply WAL data once it has
        been received from the primary server.  Thus, if one query has

       Specifies the minimum frequency for the WAL receiver
       process on the standby to send information about replication progress
       to the primary or upstream standby, where it can be seen using the

       view.  The standby will report
       the last write-ahead log location it has written, the last position it
       has flushed to disk, and the last position it has applied.
       This parameter's
       value is the maximum amount of time between reports.  Updates are
       sent each time the write or flush positions change, or at least as
       often as specified by this parameter.  Thus, the apply position may
       lag slightly behind the true position.
       If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds.
       The default value is 10 seconds.
       Setting this parameter to zero disables status updates completely.

      <a id="id-1.6.6.9.5.3.8.1.3" class="indexterm"></a>
      </span></dt><dd><p>
        Specifies whether or not a hot standby will send feedback to the primary
        or upstream standby
        about queries currently executing on the standby. This parameter can
        be used to eliminate query cancels caused by cleanup records, but
        can cause database bloat on the primary for some workloads.
        Feedback messages will not be sent more frequently than once per
        <code class="varname">wal_receiver_status_interval</code>. The default value is
        <code class="literal">off</code>. This parameter can only be set in the
        <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file or on the server command line.
       </p><p>
        If cascaded replication is in use the feedback is passed upstream
        until it eventually reaches the primary.  Standbys make no other use
        of feedback they receive other than to pass upstream.
       </p><p>
        This setting does not override the behavior of
        <code class="varname">old_snapshot_threshold</code> on the primary; a snapshot on the
        standby which exceeds the primary's age threshold can become invalid,
        resulting in cancellation of transactions on the standby.  This is
        because <code class="varname">old_snapshot_threshold</code> is intended to provide an
        absolute limit on the time which dead rows can contribute to bloat,
        which would otherwise be violated because of the configuration of a
        standby.

        Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer

        the receiving standby server to detect a primary node crash or network
        outage.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default value is 60 seconds.
        A value of zero disables the timeout mechanism.

      <a id="id-1.6.6.9.5.3.10.1.3" class="indexterm"></a>
      </span></dt><dd><p>
        Specifies how long the standby server should wait when WAL data is not
        available from any sources (streaming replication,
        local <code class="filename">pg_wal</code> or WAL archive) before trying
        again to retrieve WAL data.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default value is 5 seconds.
        This parameter can only be set in
        the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file or on the server
        command line.
       </p><p>
        This parameter is useful in configurations where a node in recovery
        needs to control the amount of time to wait for new WAL data to be
        available. For example, in archive recovery, it is possible to
        make the recovery more responsive in the detection of a new WAL
        log file by reducing the value of this parameter. On a system with
        low WAL activity, increasing it reduces the amount of requests necessary
        to access WAL archives, something useful for example in cloud
        environments where the amount of times an infrastructure is accessed
        is taken into account.
       </p></dd><dt id="GUC-RECOVERY-MIN-APPLY-DELAY"><span class="term"><code class="varname">recovery_min_apply_delay</code> (<code class="type">integer</code>)

      </span></dt><dd><p>
        By default, a standby server restores WAL records from the
        sending server as soon as possible. It may be useful to have a time-delayed
        copy of the data, offering opportunities to correct data loss errors.
        This parameter allows you to delay recovery by a specified amount
        of time.  For example, if
        you set this parameter to <code class="literal">5min</code>, the standby will
        replay each transaction commit only when the system time on the standby
        is at least five minutes past the commit time reported by the master.
        If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds.
        The default is zero, adding no delay.
       </p><p>
        It is possible that the replication delay between servers exceeds the
        value of this parameter, in which case no delay is added.
        Note that the delay is calculated between the WAL time stamp as written
        on master and the current time on the standby. Delays in transfer
        because of network lag or cascading replication configurations
        may reduce the actual wait time significantly. If the system
        clocks on master and standby are not synchronized, this may lead to
        recovery applying records earlier than expected; but that is not a
        major issue because useful settings of this parameter are much larger
        than typical time deviations between servers.
       </p><p>
        The delay occurs only on WAL records for transaction commits.
        Other records are replayed as quickly as possible, which
        is not a problem because MVCC visibility rules ensure their effects
        are not visible until the corresponding commit record is applied.
       </p><p>
        The delay occurs once the database in recovery has reached a consistent
        state, until the standby is promoted or triggered. After that the standby
        will end recovery without further waiting.
       </p><p>
        This parameter is intended for use with streaming replication deployments;
        however, if the parameter is specified it will be honored in all cases
        except crash recovery.

        <code class="varname">hot_standby_feedback</code> will be delayed by use of this feature
        which could lead to bloat on the master; use both together with care.
