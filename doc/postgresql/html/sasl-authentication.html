<em class="firstterm">SASL</em> is a framework for authentication in connection-oriented
protocols. At the moment, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> implements two SASL
authentication mechanisms, SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS. More
might be added in the future. The below steps illustrate how SASL
authentication is performed in general, while the next subsection gives
more details on SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS.
</p><div class="procedure" id="id-1.10.5.8.3"><p class="title"><strong>SASL Authentication Message Flow</strong></p><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step" id="SASL-AUTH-BEGIN"><p>
  To begin a SASL authentication exchange, the server sends an
  AuthenticationSASL message. It includes a list of SASL authentication
  mechanisms that the server can accept, in the server's preferred order.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SASL-AUTH-INITIAL-RESPONSE"><p>
  The client selects one of the supported mechanisms from the list, and sends
  a SASLInitialResponse message to the server. The message includes the name
  of the selected mechanism, and an optional Initial Client Response, if the
  selected mechanism uses that.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SASL-AUTH-CONTINUE"><p>
  One or more server-challenge and client-response message will follow. Each
  server-challenge is sent in an AuthenticationSASLContinue message, followed
  by a response from client in an SASLResponse message. The particulars of
  the messages are mechanism specific.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SASL-AUTH-END"><p>
  Finally, when the authentication exchange is completed successfully, the
  server sends an AuthenticationSASLFinal message, followed
  immediately by an AuthenticationOk message. The AuthenticationSASLFinal
  contains additional server-to-client data, whose content is particular to the
  selected authentication mechanism. If the authentication mechanism doesn't
  use additional data that's sent at completion, the AuthenticationSASLFinal
  message is not sent.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
On error, the server can abort the authentication at any stage, and send an
ErrorMessage.
</p><div class="sect2" id="SASL-SCRAM-SHA-256"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">52.3.1. SCRAM-SHA-256 Authentication</h3></div></div></div><p>
   The implemented SASL mechanisms at the moment
   are <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> and its variant with channel
   binding <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</code>. They are described in
   detail in RFC 7677 and RFC 5802.
  </p><p>
When SCRAM-SHA-256 is used in PostgreSQL, the server will ignore the user name
that the client sends in the <code class="structname">client-first-message</code>. The user name
that was already sent in the startup message is used instead.
<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports multiple character encodings, while SCRAM
dictates UTF-8 to be used for the user name, so it might be impossible to
represent the PostgreSQL user name in UTF-8.
  </p><p>
The SCRAM specification dictates that the password is also in UTF-8, and is
processed with the <em class="firstterm">SASLprep</em> algorithm.
<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, however, does not require UTF-8 to be used for
the password. When a user's password is set, it is processed with SASLprep
as if it was in UTF-8, regardless of the actual encoding used. However, if
it is not a legal UTF-8 byte sequence, or it contains UTF-8 byte sequences
that are prohibited by the SASLprep algorithm, the raw password will be used
without SASLprep processing, instead of throwing an error. This allows the
password to be normalized when it is in UTF-8, but still allows a non-UTF-8
password to be used, and doesn't require the system to know which encoding
the password is in.
  </p><p>
<em class="firstterm">Channel binding</em> is supported in PostgreSQL builds with
SSL support. The SASL mechanism name for SCRAM with channel binding is
<code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</code>.  The channel binding type used by
PostgreSQL is <code class="literal">tls-server-end-point</code>.
  </p><p>
   In <acronym class="acronym">SCRAM</acronym> without channel binding, the server chooses
   a random number that is transmitted to the client to be mixed with the
   user-supplied password in the transmitted password hash.  While this
   prevents the password hash from being successfully retransmitted in
   a later session, it does not prevent a fake server between the real
   server and client from passing through the server's random value
   and successfully authenticating.
  </p><p>
   <acronym class="acronym">SCRAM</acronym> with channel binding prevents such
   man-in-the-middle attacks by mixing the signature of the server's
   certificate into the transmitted password hash. While a fake server can
   retransmit the real server's certificate, it doesn't have access to the
   private key matching that certificate, and therefore cannot prove it is
   the owner, causing SSL connection failure.
  </p><div class="procedure" id="id-1.10.5.8.5.8"><p class="title"><strong>Example</strong></p><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step" id="SCRAM-BEGIN"><p>
  The server sends an AuthenticationSASL message. It includes a list of
  SASL authentication mechanisms that the server can accept.
  This will be <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</code>
  and <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> if the server is built with SSL
  support, or else just the latter.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SCRAM-CLIENT-FIRST"><p>
  The client responds by sending a SASLInitialResponse message, which
  indicates the chosen mechanism, <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256</code> or
  <code class="literal">SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</code>. (A client is free to choose either
  mechanism, but for better security it should choose the channel-binding
  variant if it can support it.) In the Initial Client response field, the
  message contains the SCRAM <code class="structname">client-first-message</code>.
  The <code class="structname">client-first-message</code> also contains the channel
  binding type chosen by the client.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST"><p>
  Server sends an AuthenticationSASLContinue message, with a SCRAM
  <code class="structname">server-first-message</code> as the content.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SCRAM-CLIENT-FINAL"><p>
  Client sends a SASLResponse message, with SCRAM
  <code class="structname">client-final-message</code> as the content.
</p></li><li class="step" id="SCRAM-SERVER-FINAL"><p>
  Server sends an AuthenticationSASLFinal message, with the SCRAM
  <code class="structname">server-final-message</code>, followed immediately by
  an AuthenticationOk message.
