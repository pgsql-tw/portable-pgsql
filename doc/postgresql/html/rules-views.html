    Views in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> are implemented
    using the rule system. In fact, there is essentially no difference
    between:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab;
</pre><p>

    compared against the two commands:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE myview (<em class="replaceable"><code>same column list as mytab</code></em>);
CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS ON SELECT TO myview DO INSTEAD
    SELECT * FROM mytab;
</pre><p>

    because this is exactly what the <code class="command">CREATE VIEW</code>
    command does internally.  This has some side effects. One of them
    is that the information about a view in the
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> system catalogs is exactly
    the same as it is for a table. So for the parser, there is
    absolutely no difference between a table and a view. They are the
    same thing: relations.
</p><div class="sect2" id="RULES-SELECT"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">40.2.1. How <code class="command">SELECT</code> Rules Work</h3></div></div></div><a id="id-1.8.6.7.5.2" class="indexterm"></a><p>
    Rules <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> are applied to all queries as the last step, even
    if the command given is an <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code>. And they
    have different semantics from rules on the other command types in that they modify the
    query tree in place instead of creating a new one.  So
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> rules are described first.
</p><p>
    Currently, there can be only one action in an <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> rule, and it must
    be an unconditional <code class="command">SELECT</code> action that is <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code>. This restriction was
    required to make rules safe enough to open them for ordinary users, and
    it restricts <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> rules to act like views.
</p><p>
    The examples for this chapter are two join views that do some
    calculations and some more views using them in turn.  One of the
    two first views is customized later by adding rules for
    <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and
    <code class="command">DELETE</code> operations so that the final result will
    be a view that behaves like a real table with some magic
    functionality.  This is not such a simple example to start from and
    this makes things harder to get into. But it's better to have one
    example that covers all the points discussed step by step rather
    than having many different ones that might mix up in mind.
</p><p>
    The real tables we need in the first two rule system descriptions
    are these:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE shoe_data (
    shoename   text,          -- primary key
    sh_avail   integer,       -- available number of pairs
    slcolor    text,          -- preferred shoelace color
    slminlen   real,          -- minimum shoelace length
    slmaxlen   real,          -- maximum shoelace length
    slunit     text           -- length unit
);

CREATE TABLE shoelace_data (
    sl_name    text,          -- primary key
    sl_avail   integer,       -- available number of pairs
    sl_color   text,          -- shoelace color
    sl_len     real,          -- shoelace length
    sl_unit    text           -- length unit
);

CREATE TABLE unit (
    un_name    text,          -- primary key
    un_fact    real           -- factor to transform to cm
);
</pre><p>

    As you can see, they represent shoe-store data.
</p><p>
    The views are created as:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE VIEW shoe AS
    SELECT sh.shoename,
           sh.sh_avail,
           sh.slcolor,
           sh.slminlen,
           sh.slminlen * un.un_fact AS slminlen_cm,
           sh.slmaxlen,
           sh.slmaxlen * un.un_fact AS slmaxlen_cm,
           sh.slunit
      FROM shoe_data sh, unit un
     WHERE sh.slunit = un.un_name;

CREATE VIEW shoelace AS
    SELECT s.sl_name,
           s.sl_avail,
           s.sl_color,
           s.sl_len,
           s.sl_unit,
           s.sl_len * u.un_fact AS sl_len_cm
      FROM shoelace_data s, unit u
     WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name;

CREATE VIEW shoe_ready AS
    SELECT rsh.shoename,
           rsh.sh_avail,
           rsl.sl_name,
           rsl.sl_avail,
           least(rsh.sh_avail, rsl.sl_avail) AS total_avail
      FROM shoe rsh, shoelace rsl
     WHERE rsl.sl_color = rsh.slcolor
       AND rsl.sl_len_cm &gt;= rsh.slminlen_cm
       AND rsl.sl_len_cm &lt;= rsh.slmaxlen_cm;
</pre><p>

    The <code class="command">CREATE VIEW</code> command for the
    <code class="literal">shoelace</code> view (which is the simplest one we
    have) will create a relation <code class="literal">shoelace</code> and an entry in
    <code class="structname">pg_rewrite</code> that tells that there is a
    rewrite rule that must be applied whenever the relation <code class="literal">shoelace</code>
    is referenced in a query's range table.  The rule has no rule
    qualification (discussed later, with the non-<code class="command">SELECT</code> rules, since
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> rules currently cannot have them) and it is <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code>. Note
    that rule qualifications are not the same as query qualifications.
    The action of our rule has a query qualification.
    The action of the rule is one query tree that is a copy of the
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> statement in the view creation command.
</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
    The two extra range
    table entries for <code class="literal">NEW</code> and <code class="literal">OLD</code> that you can see in
    the <code class="structname">pg_rewrite</code> entry aren't of interest
    for <code class="command">SELECT</code> rules.
    </p></div><p>
    Now we populate <code class="literal">unit</code>, <code class="literal">shoe_data</code>
    and <code class="literal">shoelace_data</code> and run a simple query on a view:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO unit VALUES ('cm', 1.0);
INSERT INTO unit VALUES ('m', 100.0);
INSERT INTO unit VALUES ('inch', 2.54);

INSERT INTO shoe_data VALUES ('sh1', 2, 'black', 70.0, 90.0, 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoe_data VALUES ('sh2', 0, 'black', 30.0, 40.0, 'inch');
INSERT INTO shoe_data VALUES ('sh3', 4, 'brown', 50.0, 65.0, 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoe_data VALUES ('sh4', 3, 'brown', 40.0, 50.0, 'inch');

INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl1', 5, 'black', 80.0, 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl2', 6, 'black', 100.0, 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl3', 0, 'black', 35.0 , 'inch');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl4', 8, 'black', 40.0 , 'inch');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl5', 4, 'brown', 1.0 , 'm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl6', 0, 'brown', 0.9 , 'm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl7', 7, 'brown', 60 , 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl8', 1, 'brown', 40 , 'inch');

SELECT * FROM shoelace;

 sl_name   | sl_avail | sl_color | sl_len | sl_unit | sl_len_cm
-----------+----------+----------+--------+---------+-----------
 sl1       |        5 | black    |     80 | cm      |        80
 sl2       |        6 | black    |    100 | cm      |       100
 sl7       |        7 | brown    |     60 | cm      |        60
 sl3       |        0 | black    |     35 | inch    |      88.9
 sl4       |        8 | black    |     40 | inch    |     101.6
 sl8       |        1 | brown    |     40 | inch    |     101.6

 sl6       |        0 | brown    |    0.9 | m       |        90
(8 rows)
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    This is the simplest <code class="command">SELECT</code> you can do on our
    views, so we take this opportunity to explain the basics of view
    rules.  The <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM shoelace</code> was
    interpreted by the parser and produced the query tree:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT shoelace.sl_name, shoelace.sl_avail,
       shoelace.sl_color, shoelace.sl_len,
       shoelace.sl_unit, shoelace.sl_len_cm
  FROM shoelace shoelace;
</pre><p>

    and this is given to the rule system. The rule system walks through the
    range table and checks if there are rules
    for any relation. When processing the range table entry for
    <code class="literal">shoelace</code> (the only one up to now) it finds the
    <code class="literal">_RETURN</code> rule with the query tree:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT s.sl_name, s.sl_avail,
       s.sl_color, s.sl_len, s.sl_unit,
       s.sl_len * u.un_fact AS sl_len_cm
  FROM shoelace old, shoelace new,
       shoelace_data s, unit u
 WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
    To expand the view, the rewriter simply creates a subquery range-table
    entry containing the rule's action query tree, and substitutes this
    range table entry for the original one that referenced the view.  The
    resulting rewritten query tree is almost the same as if you had typed:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT shoelace.sl_name, shoelace.sl_avail,
       shoelace.sl_color, shoelace.sl_len,
       shoelace.sl_unit, shoelace.sl_len_cm
  FROM (SELECT s.sl_name,
               s.sl_avail,
               s.sl_color,
               s.sl_len,
               s.sl_unit,
               s.sl_len * u.un_fact AS sl_len_cm
          FROM shoelace_data s, unit u
         WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name) shoelace;
</pre><p>

     There is one difference however: the subquery's range table has two
     extra entries <code class="literal">shoelace old</code> and <code class="literal">shoelace new</code>.  These entries don't
     participate directly in the query, since they aren't referenced by
     the subquery's join tree or target list.  The rewriter uses them
     to store the access privilege check information that was originally present
     in the range-table entry that referenced the view.  In this way, the
     executor will still check that the user has proper privileges to access
     the view, even though there's no direct use of the view in the rewritten
     query.
</p><p>
    That was the first rule applied.  The rule system will continue checking
    the remaining range-table entries in the top query (in this example there
    are no more), and it will recursively check the range-table entries in
    the added subquery to see if any of them reference views.  (But it
    won't expand <code class="literal">old</code> or <code class="literal">new</code> — otherwise we'd have infinite recursion!)
    In this example, there are no rewrite rules for <code class="literal">shoelace_data</code> or <code class="literal">unit</code>,
    so rewriting is complete and the above is the final result given to
    the planner.
</p><p>
    Now we want to write a query that finds out for which shoes currently in the store
    we have the matching shoelaces (color and length) and where the
    total number of exactly matching pairs is greater or equal to two.

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM shoe_ready WHERE total_avail &gt;= 2;

 shoename | sh_avail | sl_name | sl_avail | total_avail
----------+----------+---------+----------+-------------
 sh1      |        2 | sl1     |        5 |           2
 sh3      |        4 | sl7     |        7 |           4
(2 rows)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
    The output of the parser this time is the query tree:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT shoe_ready.shoename, shoe_ready.sh_avail,
       shoe_ready.sl_name, shoe_ready.sl_avail,
       shoe_ready.total_avail
  FROM shoe_ready shoe_ready
 WHERE shoe_ready.total_avail &gt;= 2;
</pre><p>

    The first rule applied will be the one for the
    <code class="literal">shoe_ready</code> view and it results in the
    query tree:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT shoe_ready.shoename, shoe_ready.sh_avail,
       shoe_ready.sl_name, shoe_ready.sl_avail,
       shoe_ready.total_avail
  FROM (SELECT rsh.shoename,
               rsh.sh_avail,
               rsl.sl_name,
               rsl.sl_avail,
               least(rsh.sh_avail, rsl.sl_avail) AS total_avail
          FROM shoe rsh, shoelace rsl
         WHERE rsl.sl_color = rsh.slcolor
           AND rsl.sl_len_cm &gt;= rsh.slminlen_cm
           AND rsl.sl_len_cm &lt;= rsh.slmaxlen_cm) shoe_ready
 WHERE shoe_ready.total_avail &gt;= 2;
</pre><p>

    Similarly, the rules for <code class="literal">shoe</code> and
    <code class="literal">shoelace</code> are substituted into the range table of
    the subquery, leading to a three-level final query tree:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT shoe_ready.shoename, shoe_ready.sh_avail,
       shoe_ready.sl_name, shoe_ready.sl_avail,
       shoe_ready.total_avail
  FROM (SELECT rsh.shoename,
               rsh.sh_avail,
               rsl.sl_name,
               rsl.sl_avail,
               least(rsh.sh_avail, rsl.sl_avail) AS total_avail
          FROM (SELECT sh.shoename,
                       sh.sh_avail,
                       sh.slcolor,
                       sh.slminlen,
                       sh.slminlen * un.un_fact AS slminlen_cm,
                       sh.slmaxlen,
                       sh.slmaxlen * un.un_fact AS slmaxlen_cm,
                       sh.slunit
                  FROM shoe_data sh, unit un
                 WHERE sh.slunit = un.un_name) rsh,
               (SELECT s.sl_name,
                       s.sl_avail,
                       s.sl_color,
                       s.sl_len,
                       s.sl_unit,
                       s.sl_len * u.un_fact AS sl_len_cm
                  FROM shoelace_data s, unit u
                 WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name) rsl
         WHERE rsl.sl_color = rsh.slcolor
           AND rsl.sl_len_cm &gt;= rsh.slminlen_cm
           AND rsl.sl_len_cm &lt;= rsh.slmaxlen_cm) shoe_ready
 WHERE shoe_ready.total_avail &gt; 2;
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    This might look inefficient, but the planner will collapse this into a
    single-level query tree by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pulling up</span>”</span> the subqueries,
    and then it will plan the joins just as if we'd written them out
    manually.  So collapsing the query tree is an optimization that the
    rewrite system doesn't have to concern itself with.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" id="id-1.8.6.7.6"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">40.2.2. View Rules in Non-<code class="command">SELECT</code> Statements</h3></div></div></div><p>
    Two details of the query tree aren't touched in the description of
    view rules above. These are the command type and the result relation.
    In fact, the command type is not needed by view rules, but the result
    relation may affect the way in which the query rewriter works, because
    special care needs to be taken if the result relation is a view.
</p><p>
    There are only a few differences between a query tree for a
    <code class="command">SELECT</code> and one for any other
    command. Obviously, they have a different command type and for a
    command other than a <code class="command">SELECT</code>, the result
    relation points to the range-table entry where the result should
    go.  Everything else is absolutely the same.  So having two tables
    <code class="literal">t1</code> and <code class="literal">t2</code> with columns <code class="literal">a</code> and
    <code class="literal">b</code>, the query trees for the two statements:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT t2.b FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;

UPDATE t1 SET b = t2.b FROM t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;
</pre><p>

    are nearly identical.  In particular:

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            The range tables contain entries for the tables <code class="literal">t1</code> and <code class="literal">t2</code>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The target lists contain one variable that points to column
            <code class="literal">b</code> of the range table entry for table <code class="literal">t2</code>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The qualification expressions compare the columns <code class="literal">a</code> of both
            range-table entries for equality.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The join trees show a simple join between <code class="literal">t1</code> and <code class="literal">t2</code>.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
   </p><p>
    The consequence is, that both query trees result in similar
    execution plans: They are both joins over the two tables. For the
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code> the missing columns from <code class="literal">t1</code> are added to
    the target list by the planner and the final query tree will read
    as:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
UPDATE t1 SET a = t1.a, b = t2.b FROM t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;
</pre><p>

    and thus the executor run over the join will produce exactly the
    same result set as:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT t1.a, t2.b FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;
</pre><p>

    But there is a little problem in
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>: the part of the executor plan that does
    the join does not care what the results from the join are
    meant for. It just produces a result set of rows. The fact that
    one is a <code class="command">SELECT</code> command and the other is an
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code> is handled higher up in the executor, where
    it knows that this is an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and it knows that
    this result should go into table <code class="literal">t1</code>. But which of the rows
    that are there has to be replaced by the new row?
</p><p>
    To resolve this problem, another entry is added to the target list
    in <code class="command">UPDATE</code> (and also in
    <code class="command">DELETE</code>) statements: the current tuple ID
    (<acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym>).<a id="id-1.8.6.7.6.5.4" class="indexterm"></a>
    This is a system column containing the
    file block number and position in the block for the row. Knowing
    the table, the <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> can be used to retrieve the
    original row of <code class="literal">t1</code> to be updated.  After adding the
    <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> to the target list, the query actually looks like:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT t1.a, t2.b, t1.ctid FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;
</pre><p>

    Now another detail of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> enters
    the stage. Old table rows aren't overwritten, and this
    is why <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code> is fast. In an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>,
    the new result row is inserted into the table (after stripping the
    <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym>) and in the row header of the old row, which the
    <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> pointed to, the <code class="literal">cmax</code> and
    <code class="literal">xmax</code> entries are set to the current command counter
    and current transaction ID. Thus the old row is hidden, and after
    the transaction commits the vacuum cleaner can eventually remove
    the dead row.
</p><p>
    Knowing all that, we can simply apply view rules in absolutely
    the same way to any command. There is no difference.
</p></div><div class="sect2" id="id-1.8.6.7.7"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">40.2.3. The Power of Views in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span></h3></div></div></div><p>
    The above demonstrates how the rule system incorporates view
    definitions into the original query tree. In the second example, a
    simple <code class="command">SELECT</code> from one view created a final
    query tree that is a join of 4 tables (<code class="literal">unit</code> was used twice with
    different names).
</p><p>
    The benefit of implementing views with the rule system is,
    that the planner has all
    the information about which tables have to be scanned plus the
    relationships between these tables plus the restrictive
    qualifications from the views plus the qualifications from
    the original query
    in one single query tree. And this is still the situation
    when the original query is already a join over views.
    The planner has to decide which is
    the best path to execute the query, and the more information
    the planner has, the better this decision can be. And
    the rule system as implemented in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    ensures, that this is all information available about the query
    up to that point.
</p></div><div class="sect2" id="RULES-VIEWS-UPDATE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">40.2.4. Updating a View</h3></div></div></div><p>
    What happens if a view is named as the target relation for an
    <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, or
    <code class="command">DELETE</code>?  Doing the substitutions
    described above would give a query tree in which the result
    relation points at a subquery range-table entry, which will not
    work.  There are several ways in which <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    can support the appearance of updating a view, however.
</p><p>
    If the subquery selects from a single base relation and is simple
    enough, the rewriter can automatically replace the subquery with the
    underlying base relation so that the <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="command">DELETE</code> is applied to
    the base relation in the appropriate way.  Views that are
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">simple enough</span>”</span> for this are called <em class="firstterm">automatically
    updatable</em>.  For detailed information on the kinds of view that can
    be automatically updated, see <a class="xref" href="sql-createview.html" title="CREATE VIEW"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE VIEW</span></a>.
</p><p>
    Alternatively, the operation may be handled by a user-provided
    <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF</code> trigger on the view.
    Rewriting works slightly differently
    in this case.  For <code class="command">INSERT</code>, the rewriter does
    nothing at all with the view, leaving it as the result relation
    for the query.  For <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and
    <code class="command">DELETE</code>, it's still necessary to expand the
    view query to produce the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">old</span>”</span> rows that the command will
    attempt to update or delete.  So the view is expanded as normal,
    but another unexpanded range-table entry is added to the query
    to represent the view in its capacity as the result relation.
</p><p>
    The problem that now arises is how to identify the rows to be
    updated in the view. Recall that when the result relation
    is a table, a special <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym> entry is added to the target
    list to identify the physical locations of the rows to be updated.
    This does not work if the result relation is a view, because a view
    does not have any <acronym class="acronym">CTID</acronym>, since its rows do not have
    actual physical locations. Instead, for an <code class="command">UPDATE</code>
    or <code class="command">DELETE</code> operation, a special <code class="literal">wholerow</code>
    entry is added to the target list, which expands to include all
    columns from the view. The executor uses this value to supply the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">old</span>”</span> row to the <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF</code> trigger.  It is
    up to the trigger to work out what to update based on the old and
    new row values.
</p><p>
    Another possibility is for the user to define <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code>
    rules that specify substitute actions for <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">DELETE</code> commands on
    a view. These rules will rewrite the command, typically into a command
    that updates one or more tables, rather than views. That is the topic
    of <a class="xref" href="rules-update.html" title="40.4. Rules on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE">Section 40.4</a>.
</p><p>
    Note that rules are evaluated first, rewriting the original query
    before it is planned and executed. Therefore, if a view has
    <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF</code> triggers as well as rules on <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="command">DELETE</code>, then the rules will be
    evaluated first, and depending on the result, the triggers may not be
    used at all.
</p><p>
    Automatic rewriting of an <code class="command">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, or <code class="command">DELETE</code> query on a
    simple view is always tried last. Therefore, if a view has rules or
    triggers, they will override the default behavior of automatically
    updatable views.
</p><p>
    If there are no <code class="literal">INSTEAD</code> rules or <code class="literal">INSTEAD OF</code>
    triggers for the view, and the rewriter cannot automatically rewrite
    the query as an update on the underlying base relation, an error will
    be thrown because the executor cannot update a view as such.
