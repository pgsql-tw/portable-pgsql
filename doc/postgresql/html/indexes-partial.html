   A <em class="firstterm">partial index</em> is an index built over a
   subset of a table; the subset is defined by a conditional
   expression (called the <em class="firstterm">predicate</em> of the
   partial index).  The index contains entries only for those table
   rows that satisfy the predicate.  Partial indexes are a specialized
   feature, but there are several situations in which they are useful.
  </p><p>
   One major reason for using a partial index is to avoid indexing common
   values.  Since a query searching for a common value (one that
   accounts for more than a few percent of all the table rows) will not
   use the index anyway, there is no point in keeping those rows in the
   index at all.  This reduces the size of the index, which will speed
   up those queries that do use the index.  It will also speed up many table
   update operations because the index does not need to be
   updated in all cases.  <a class="xref" href="indexes-partial.html#INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX1" title="Example 11.1. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Common Values">Example 11.1</a> shows a
   possible application of this idea.
  </p><div class="example" id="INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX1"><p class="title"><strong>Example 11.1. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Common Values</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><p>
    Suppose you are storing web server access logs in a database.
    Most accesses originate from the IP address range of your organization but
    some are from elsewhere (say, employees on dial-up connections).
    If your searches by IP are primarily for outside accesses,
    you probably do not need to index the IP range that corresponds to your
    organization's subnet.
   </p><p>
    Assume a table like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE access_log (
    url varchar,
    client_ip inet,
    ...
);
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    To create a partial index that suits our example, use a command
    such as this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE INDEX access_log_client_ip_ix ON access_log (client_ip)
WHERE NOT (client_ip &gt; inet '192.168.100.0' AND
           client_ip &lt; inet '192.168.100.255');
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    A typical query that can use this index would be:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT *
FROM access_log
WHERE url = '/index.html' AND client_ip = inet '212.78.10.32';
</pre><p>
    Here the query's IP address is covered by the partial index.  The
    following query cannot use the partial index, as it uses an IP address
    that is excluded from the index:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT *
FROM access_log
WHERE url = '/index.html' AND client_ip = inet '192.168.100.23';
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    Observe that this kind of partial index requires that the common
    values be predetermined, so such partial indexes are best used for
    data distributions that do not change.  Such indexes can be recreated
    occasionally to adjust for new data distributions, but this adds
    maintenance effort.
   </p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>
   Another possible use for a partial index is to exclude values from the
   index that the
   typical query workload is not interested in; this is shown in <a class="xref" href="indexes-partial.html#INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX2" title="Example 11.2. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Uninteresting Values">Example 11.2</a>.  This results in the same
   advantages as listed above, but it prevents the
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">uninteresting</span>”</span> values from being accessed via that
   index, even if an index scan might be profitable in that
   case.  Obviously, setting up partial indexes for this kind of
   scenario will require a lot of care and experimentation.
  </p><div class="example" id="INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX2"><p class="title"><strong>Example 11.2. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Uninteresting Values</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><p>
    If you have a table that contains both billed and unbilled orders,
    where the unbilled orders take up a small fraction of the total
    table and yet those are the most-accessed rows, you can improve
    performance by creating an index on just the unbilled rows.  The
    command to create the index would look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE INDEX orders_unbilled_index ON orders (order_nr)
    WHERE billed is not true;
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    A possible query to use this index would be:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE billed is not true AND order_nr &lt; 10000;
</pre><p>
    However, the index can also be used in queries that do not involve
    <code class="structfield">order_nr</code> at all, e.g.:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE billed is not true AND amount &gt; 5000.00;
</pre><p>
    This is not as efficient as a partial index on the
    <code class="structfield">amount</code> column would be, since the system has to
    scan the entire index.  Yet, if there are relatively few unbilled
    orders, using this partial index just to find the unbilled orders
    could be a win.
   </p><p>
    Note that this query cannot use this index:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_nr = 3501;
</pre><p>
    The order 3501 might be among the billed or unbilled
    orders.
   </p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>
   <a class="xref" href="indexes-partial.html#INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX2" title="Example 11.2. Setting up a Partial Index to Exclude Uninteresting Values">Example 11.2</a> also illustrates that the
   indexed column and the column used in the predicate do not need to
   match.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports partial
   indexes with arbitrary predicates, so long as only columns of the
   table being indexed are involved.  However, keep in mind that the
   predicate must match the conditions used in the queries that
   are supposed to benefit from the index.  To be precise, a partial
   index can be used in a query only if the system can recognize that
   the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition of the query mathematically implies
   the predicate of the index.
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> does not have a sophisticated
   theorem prover that can recognize mathematically equivalent
   expressions that are written in different forms.  (Not
   only is such a general theorem prover extremely difficult to
   create, it would probably be too slow to be of any real use.)
   The system can recognize simple inequality implications, for example
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">x &lt; 1</span>”</span> implies <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">x &lt; 2</span>”</span>; otherwise
   the predicate condition must exactly match part of the query's
   <code class="literal">WHERE</code> condition
   or the index will not be recognized as usable. Matching takes
   place at query planning time, not at run time. As a result,
   parameterized query clauses do not work with a partial index. For
   example a prepared query with a parameter might specify
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">x &lt; ?</span>”</span> which will never imply
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">x &lt; 2</span>”</span> for all possible values of the parameter.
  </p><p>
   A third possible use for partial indexes does not require the
   index to be used in queries at all.  The idea here is to create
   a unique index over a subset of a table, as in <a class="xref" href="indexes-partial.html#INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX3" title="Example 11.3. Setting up a Partial Unique Index">Example 11.3</a>.  This enforces uniqueness
   among the rows that satisfy the index predicate, without constraining
   those that do not.
  </p><div class="example" id="INDEXES-PARTIAL-EX3"><p class="title"><strong>Example 11.3. Setting up a Partial Unique Index</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><p>
    Suppose that we have a table describing test outcomes.  We wish
    to ensure that there is only one <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">successful</span>”</span> entry for
    a given subject and target combination, but there might be any number of
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unsuccessful</span>”</span> entries.  Here is one way to do it:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE tests (
    subject text,
    target text,
    success boolean,
    ...
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON tests (subject, target)
    WHERE success;
</pre><p>
    This is a particularly efficient approach when there are few
    successful tests and many unsuccessful ones.
   </p><p>
    This index allows only one null in the indexed column by using a
    partial index clause to process only null column values, and using
    an expression index clause to index <code class="literal">true</code> instead
    of <code class="literal">null</code>:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_target_one_null ON tests ((target IS NULL)) WHERE target IS NULL;
</pre><p>
   </p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>
   Finally, a partial index can also be used to override the system's
   query plan choices.  Also, data sets with peculiar
   distributions might cause the system to use an index when it really
   should not.  In that case the index can be set up so that it is not
   available for the offending query.  Normally,
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> makes reasonable choices about index
   usage (e.g., it avoids them when retrieving common values, so the
   earlier example really only saves index size, it is not required to
   avoid index usage), and grossly incorrect plan choices are cause
   for a bug report.
  </p><p>
   Keep in mind that setting up a partial index indicates that you
   know at least as much as the query planner knows, in particular you
   know when an index might be profitable.  Forming this knowledge
   requires experience and understanding of how indexes in
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> work.  In most cases, the advantage of a
   partial index over a regular index will be minimal.
